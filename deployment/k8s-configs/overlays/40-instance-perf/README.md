## 🧪 Testing Procedure

### 1. Service Warm-Up
Services were warmed up until they could handle **1,000,000 concurrent reservation requests** with each pod's CPU usage under 25%.

### 2. Spike Test Execution
Generated 1,000,000 concurrent reservation requests for:
- 4 events  
- 100 areas per event  
- 400 seats per area (random continuous seat selections)

### 3. Metric Collection
Latency and trace metrics were collected from:
- Client-side
- Server-side (via OpenTelemetry)

## ✅ Conclusion

### 1. Amplified Request Volume
Due to interactive queries, each request causes nearly double the traffic:

```
1,000,000 * (1 + 39 / 40) ≈ 1,975,000 requests
```

Each service instance processed roughly:

```
1,975,000 / 40 ≈ 49,375 requests
```

---

### 2. Scalability Confirmed
Compared to [16-instance test with 400,000 requests](https://github.com/tall15421542-lab/ticket-master/tree/main/deployment/k8s-configs/overlays/16-instance-perf#-testing-result---400000-concurrent-requests):

- **P50 latency** increased by ~2.642 seconds
- **P95 latency** remained stable
- **P99 latency** improved by ~1.5 seconds

➡️ This confirms **near-linear scalability** under heavier load.

---

### 3. Significant improvement in throughput and latency
For 1,000,000 concurrent requests.
- **50% of users**: completed in under **10 seconds**
- **99% of users**: completed in under **16 seconds**

⚡ This is a significant improvement over the 5–20 minute delays reported in recent high-demand ticket sales events:
This system is **18 to 75 times faster** than Ticketmaster in those scenarios.

## 🚀 JVM Warm-Up

Java apps initially run slower due to:
- Class loading
- Bytecode interpretation

Performance increases with **JIT (Just-In-Time)** compilation.  
Warm-up ensures testing reflects the steady-state performance, not cold-start metrics.
